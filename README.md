Concepts for a simple, ATmega-driven flashcart with a CPLD mapper

This really is what it looks like. I think it would be relatively
simple to make a flashcart based on an ATmega (right now, I'm looking
at the ATmega4809), that has a CPLD mapper and can read ROMs from an
SD card. Right now, though, it is just a schematic and a concept.
